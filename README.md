## Description of the text-based game

It is basically a gameshow where the players have the chance to win thousands of dollars. Wrong decisions can lead them to lose their money.
In this gameshow, questions from various topics (maths, science, sports,  politics and international relations) will be printed on screen and 
users can earn money by giving correct answers and they may even lose money by giving wrong answers.In some rounds users will be given 4 options 
while in other rounds they have to type in the answer themselves. There will also be rapid fire round where the players have a time of 60 seconds
to answer maximum questions and an option of “Pass”. There will also be 2-3 bonus rounds of the  famous gambling game “Lucky 7”. Players will have 
a chance to multiply their money, if the dice lands on the suggested number. Lets not forget, player may even lose their money from this bonus round 
also. At all times, User’s balance will be on the screen. Initially, they will have 1000$ in their balance. After the completion of 10 rounds, player’s 
final balance will be printed on the screen.
## Features we plan to Implement
The lucky 7 game involves gambling using dice so there will be random generation of numbers. We will use arrays to store questions for each round and a random number will 
be generated and accordingly the question will be printed on the screen. We will use dynamic arrays for storing the questions.We will store the question number and money 
balance of the player using file input/output.Moreover, we will be making several functions like one for lucky 7 and another one for the rapid fire round and place them in
multiple files.
